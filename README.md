# Sales Effectivness
 FicZon Inc is an IT solution provider with products ranging from on-premises products to SAS based solutions. FicZon major leads generation channel is digital and through their website.

FicZon business is majorly dependent on the sales force effectiveness. As the market is maturing and more new competitors entering the market, FicZon is experiencing the dip in sales. Effective sales are dependent on lead quality and as of now, this is based on manual categorization and highly depended on the sales staff. Though there is a quality process, which continuously updates the lead categorization, it values is in for post-analysis, rather than conversation.

FicZon wants to explore Machine Learning to pre-categorize the lead quality and as a result, expecting a significant increase in sales effectiveness.

PROJECT GOAL:
1. Data exploration insights â€“ Sales effectiveness.
2. ML model to predict the Lead Category (High Potential, Low Potential)
